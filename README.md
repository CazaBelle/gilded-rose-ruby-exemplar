# Gilded Rose Kata 


# Requirements 
```
Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
The Quality of an item is never negative
"Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
The Quality of an item is never more than 50
"Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
"Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
Quality drops to 0 after the concert

```

# Approach 
* Mapped out the flow of data 
* Created a test suite that covered all of the edge cases for magic items 
* Separated the different items into classes and inherit from the item class
